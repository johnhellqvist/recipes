1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra, for greasing
475 g strong flour, plus extra for dusting*

In a small bowl, mix the lukewarm water, yeast and sugar together until combined, then 
leave in a warm place for five minutes or until frothy. Stir in the olive oil. Sift the 
strong flour and salt together into a large bowl. Pour the yeast mixture over the dry 
ingredients and use your hands to bring the mixture together to form a dough. 

Turn the dough out onto a work surface and use the heel of your hands to work the dough 
for five minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Lightly grease the inside of a clean 
dry bowl with oil and place the dough inside. Place a tea towel over the dough and leave 
in a warm place to prove for 45-60 minutes or until doubled in size. 

Dust a clean work surface lightly with the extra flour and tip out the dough. Use your 
fists to knock the dough back with one good punch to let any air out. Before you portion 
the dough into separate balls, refer to the pizza recipe for measures. Once you've 
separated your dough into portions, and working with one portion at a time, use the palm 
of your hands to cup the dough and roll it on the work surface in a circular motion to 
form a perfect ball. Repeat with the remaining dough portions. Place the dough balls on 
a lightly greased baking tray, cover and leave in a warm place to prove for 15 minutes.
